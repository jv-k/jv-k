### Hi thereðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me: 

â–² My programming days started back in the mid 90s
â–² I'm largely self-taught, although I took CS classes for a few years for my masters course in Cybernetics, robotics and engineering
â–² I posses at least fundamental bread 'n butter skills and experience in several of the popular languages and frameworks around, and highly competenent in at least a few
â–² Trying to be as "full stack" as I possibly can, by learning diverse skills  
â–² Being somewhat agnostic about platforms/languages, my focus has been mostly on: Everything Javascript! ðŸ’› â€” HTML â€” three.js â€” CSS â€” NodeJs â€” React â€” everything Python - APIs â€” AWS & Azure cloud platforms â€” SQLâ€” PHP â€” C++/C# â€” Github â€” bash  
â–² I aim to contribute to open source projects, as well as to release my own tools and utilities  
â–² My general software engineering interests are: machine learning â€” modern software design principles â€” design patterns â€” cloud application principles â€” automating software development workflows â€” the agile iterative approach to projects â€” UI â€” graphics

â–² Other interests: embedded programming for Arduino and Linux â€” digital electronics â€” ...and everything (lol) related to playing: guitar â€” scuba diving â€” climbing mountains

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently upskilling:
â–² Taking certifications in developing for the cloud (AWS + Azure)
â–² The modern software development lifecycle  
â–² Agile practices  
â–² The React ecosystem  
â–² NodeJS

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  
â–² An open source MacOS desktop app that lets one machine remotely control the other's screen and sound properties, using the UDP protocol, NWJS, and NodeJS
